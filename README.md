| Behavior        | Input           | Outcome  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| The program will take an age. | "21" | "21" |
| The program will take a life expectancy. | "100" | "100" |
| The program will divide the age by four different numbers, each representing a year's length on different planetary bodies in the solar system. | "21" | "87", "33", "11", "1"|
| The program will round down each of the numbers to a whole value. | "21" | "87", "33", "11", "1" |
| The program will subtract the age from the expectancy, and divide it by four different numbers, each representing a year's length on different planetary bodies in the solar system. | "100" | "329", "127", "42", "6"|
| The program will round down each of the life expectancy numbers to the nearest whole number. | "100" | "329", "127", "42", "6" |
| The program will display each of the four age numbers with a description of what they mean. | "21" | "age on mercury: 87 years", "age on venus: 33 years", "age on Mars: 11 years", "age on Jupiter: 1 years" |
| The program will display the expected life remainder for each planet | "100" | "Expected years to live on Mercury: 329 years", "Expected years to live on Venus: 127 years", "Expected years to live on Mars: 42 years", "Expected years to live on Jupiter: 6 years" |
