| Behavior        | Input           | Outcome  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| The program will take an age. | "21" | "21" |
| The program will take a life expectancy. | "100" | "100" |
| The program will divide the age by four different numbers, each representing a year's length on different planetary bodies in the solar system. | "21" | "87.5", "33.87...", "11.17...", "1.77..."|
| The program will round down each of the numbers to its 2nd decimal place. | "21" | "87.5", "33.87", "11.17", "1.77" |
| The program will subtract the age from the expectancy, and divide it by four different numbers, each representing a year's length on different planetary bodies in the solar system. | "100" | "329.16...", "127.41...", "42.02...", "6.66..."|
| The program will round down each of the life expectancy numbers to its 2nd decimal place. | "100" | "329.16", "127.41", "42.02", "6.66" |
| The program will display each of the four age numbers with a description of what they mean. | "21" | "If you were on Mercury, you would be 87.5 years old!", "If you were on Venus, you would be 33.87 years old!", "If you were on Mars, you would be 11.17 years old!", "If you were on Jupiter, you would be 1.77 years old!" |
| The program will display the expected life remainder for each planet | "100" | "If you were on Mercury, you'd have a whopping 329.16 years left to live!", "If you were on Venus, you'd have a whopping 127.41 years left to live!", "If you were on Mars, you'd have only 42.02 years left to live!", "If you were on Jupiter, you'd have only 6.66 years left to live!" |
